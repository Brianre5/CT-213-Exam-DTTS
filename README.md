# CT-213-Exam-DTTS
This project was made as part of the final exam of the CT-213 (Artificial intelligence for mobile robotics) of the ITA
Creation of an agent that learns to play Don't Touch The Spikes using imitation learning
The base game record in a .csv file every 1/60 second the actual x and y position, the previous(1/60 second before) x and y position - so that the agent can know the velocitys at which the bird is going - the position of the spikes and the decision of the player, 1 for jump and 0 for nothing.
The agent willwith an Supervised Learning neural network.
